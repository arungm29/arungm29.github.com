Hello people! After a week of hard work, I finally made this site from scratch. It's not much, but it's a start!

I plan to shift this to my own domain sometime, when I have the money. I decided to build this site mostly to try out GitHub. I still haven't figured it out completely yet, and got stuck more often than I'd like to admit, but yeah, I finally made it! My first repo on GitHub. Open source, here I come! Anyway, on this blog, I shall keep you updated on what I am working on, and my thoughts on them. Also, I might make tutorials in case I learn something worth sharing.

For those who are interested, this site is served through the amazing [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) platform. I'm also going to try and enable comments on this blog. For now, just contact me like I mentioned below.

Until next time!
