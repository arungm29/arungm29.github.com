Well, it turns out that Twitter isn't exactly an original idea. Apparently, LiveJournal was the Twitter of the 2000's. Have a look at [this](http://brad.livejournal.com/2000/04/05/). As it turns out, there was a Linux client for LiveJournal called [LoserJabber](http://loserjabber.sourceforge.net/), which looked something like this.

You see the small textbox and the submit button? It was exactly like Twitter!

While we're on the subject, I wish I was 10 years older. Reading all these articles about the internet of the late 90's and 2000's, I can't shake off the idea that the communities that existed back then were far more interesting. Too bad I was 10 years old back then, and spent all my time playing Jazz Jackrabbit. In fact, people only seem to be rediscovering things that were already invented. No, BitTorrent did not invent P2P file sharing. Does anyone remember Audiogalaxy? Or the directories in Yahoo? I miss that internet.
